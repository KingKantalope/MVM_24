    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added new APIs that enable users to directly provide a collection of `float3` knot positions to a `Spline` constructor, or to the new `Add`, `AddRange`, `Insert`, and `InsertRange` methods, instead of using `BezierKnots`.\n- Added an event to the `SplineAnimate` component that is triggered when the animation or loop is completed.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed supported version in the documentation dropdown selector to 2022.3 and later. \n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- [SPLB-246] Fixed performance and garbage collection (GC) memory allocation issues when evaluating splines using `SplineContainer` API.\n- [STO-3176] Fixed an issue where `FitSplineToPoints` utility would not fit splines correctly.\n- [SPLB-249] Fixed a bug where setting a spline game object position was overridden by the knot placement tool.\n- Fixed a bug where using the knot placement tool on scaled objects would not create the correct tangents.\n- Fixed a bug where changing the scale of a spline game object would not update the scene view handles.\n- [SPLB-239] Fixed a bug where reverting overrides of a spline prefab instance would not properly update its visuals.\n- [SPLB-238] Fixed a bug where `SplineAnimate` component would continuously output messages to the Console when in playmode and animated object was selected.\n- [SPLB-245] Fixed a bug where `SplineAnimate` component would rotate the animated object on playmode exit."
